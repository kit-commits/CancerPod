# CancerPod
A mobile application for people who have cancer. It implements ethical data privacy protections. 

Cancer Pod utilizes ethical privacy safeguards to protect the data of cancer patients and their immediate family members. 
This app re-directs patients towards evidence based cancer care, without selling their data "to shady third parties."
It's expert guided and avoids dark patterns. 
It allows patients to understand who to see, the right questions to ask a doctor, and how to interpret outcomes. 

Cancer Pod is not a replacement for a trained physician. Canncer Pod re-directs the patient to a trained physician. 

This is an "ethics positive" healthcare app that is meant to withstand scrutiny from responsible tech accelerators (Y Combinator), academic review, and graduate level evaluation. 

1. The Problem statement for this app.
   Here are some common problems that current cancer patients face.

   - Cancer patients will oftentimes basically have to piece together fragmented "bits of information" from different providers and institutions.
   - Having to deal with varrying success rates between different treatment pathways.
   - It can actually be surprisingly hard for them to see the depth of what a physician has specialized in, and what their track record is with their type of cancer.
   - When there is a cancer patient who is extremely stressed out, they will experience "cognitive overload".
  
   - This is why this app aims to avoid "the less ethical patterns that pop up in some healthcare apps", like gamification, using tools that optimize for engagement, data extraction, or lead generation.
  
   - This is an app that respects patient autonomy and trust.
  
 2. What Cancer Pod is:
    -A research backed visualization tool for supporting treatment pathways and outcomes.
    -A tool that is built in a way so that privacy protections become the foundation.
    -Respecting patient consent and minimizing their data trail.

3. What Is Cancer Pod Not?
   -Cancer Pod is not a medical advice search engine.
   -Cancer Pod is not about rating doctors or "creating a marketplace".
   -There are absolutely no ads or data resells in order to protect patients.
   -Absolutely no gamification. That is the worst thing to include in a healthcare app.

4. What Truly Makes This App "Fill The Right Kind Of Niche":
   -This is an app that respects a cancer patient's ability to reason.
   -Cognitive Respect.
   -Plain Language.
   -No Dark Patterns.
   -No Dopamine Loops.
   -Explicit Uncertainty.
   -Avoiding False Precision.
   -Calm Accessibility.

5. What High Value Signals Does This App Include:
   -Treatment Pathways.
   -Physician Specialization Depth.
   -Outcome Distributions [Not Specialization Depth].
   -Ethical & Peer Signals.

6. Privacy And Data Architecture [High-Level]
   -Privacy By Design.
   -Explicit And Granular Opt-In For Data Sharing.
   -Data Minimization.
   -Pseudonymization Where Aggregation Is Required.
   -Absolutely No Ads.

7. Current Status:
   -Conceptual MVP Defined.
   -Core Screens And User Journey Outlined.
   -Drafts of Ethical Disclosures, Bias Statements, and Patient Consent Forms.
   -No live patient ingestion.
   -There are no clinical claims made.

8. Intended Review Audience:
   -Academic Programs (HCI, Health Informatics, Ethics Teams, And Data Science Specialists).
   -Early-stage, ethics-aligned accelerators.
   -Clinicians and researchers interested in patient facing decision tools.

Disclaimer: 
This is not an app that is about maximizing engagement or revenue. This app is designed to reduce harm and confussion for the patient base. This is about being a steward, not a disruptor tourist.
