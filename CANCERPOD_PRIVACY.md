# Privacy Policy — Cancer Pod MVP

## 1. Core Principles
- We prioritize user safety, confidentiality, and ethical routing to care.  
- This app is **not diagnostic**; it is a decision-support and referral tool.  
- Users retain full control over their data, including deletion and export.  
- No data is sold, shared for advertising, or used outside of approved clinical purposes.

---

## 2. Data Collected
- Signals relevant to care routing (e.g., validated symptom patterns, age bracket, prior doctor type)  
- Optional user input for personal context or questions  
- System logs for MVP debugging (pseudonymized)

**What we do NOT collect:**  
- Raw medical records without explicit consent  
- Personally identifiable information beyond what users provide  
- Any data for secondary commercial purposes

---

## 3. User Control
- Explicit opt-in is required for all data collection.  
- Users can revoke consent at any time.  
- Users can export or delete all data. After deletion, no personal traces remain on servers.  

---

## 4. Security Measures
- On-device processing is used wherever possible.  
- Pseudonymization ensures sensitive data is never directly linked to identity.  
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.  
- Firebase security rules limit access to approved backend functions.

---

## 5. Human Oversight
- Risk flags always include human review pathways.  
- Users are encouraged to consult existing care providers.  
- No automated recommendations replace clinical judgment.

---

## 6. Third-Party Services
- Firebase is used for backend storage.  
- No advertising, no reselling, no analytics outside of opt-in research studies.

---

## 7. Transparency
- The system clearly communicates limitations and uncertainties.  
- Users are never misled about what the AI can or cannot do.
